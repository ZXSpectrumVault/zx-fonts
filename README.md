# ZX Fonts

This is a large collection of fonts extracted from ZX Spectrum games and utilities using the [PixelWorld](https://github.com/damieng/pixelworld) tool to find them.

## Files

- ch8 - Contains raw 768-byte ZX Spectrum fonts
- png - Contains a mono PNG representation of the font

## Copyright

Fonts are generally not copyrightable in the UK or USA and the only reason that OTF/TTF files are copyrightable is due to the "code" they contain within for hinting and measurement.

As bitmap fonts have no executable component it is believed these fonts are also not copyrightable. Indeed some high-profile "borrowing" of fonts has included:

- The ZX Spectrum font used in the Google Nexus 4 bootloader
- The Commodore VIC-20 font used in the Apple Lisa debugger and in Castlevania
- The Atari "arcade" font used by Namco and many others

That said nothing in this repo should be construed as legal advice as I am not a lawyer and I do not have the authority to grant you any special rights to these files.
